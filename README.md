## Why do we recognize the larvae of the pea aphid?
<p>1.Instantly determining the age of the pea aphid from images can speed up research into development.
<p>2.By applying this web application, accurate monitoring in the field becomes possible. This allows the field conditions to be accurately grasped, contributing to pest control.</p>
